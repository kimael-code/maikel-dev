  Hello! I'm Maikel Carballo, a passionate Full Stack Web Developer and IT Professor based in La Guaira, Venezuela. My main goal is to build high-quality software that not only meets technical requirements but also streamlines processes and delivers real value to organizations.

  ### The Programmer & Professor

  With a solid track record of over five years, I have had the privilege of collaborating with major public sector institutions in Venezuela. I currently serve as a Systems Analyst at a public financial institution, responsible for developing and maintaining critical applications for internal process management. Using technologies like: PHP (Laravel, Yii2), Vue.js, Inertia.js, PostgreSQL and Docker. My experience also includes my role as a Programmer Analyst. Additionally, I have cultivated my passion for teaching as a Programming Professor at Universidad Nueva Esparta, contributing to the education of future talent in the technology field.

  ### Beyond the Screen

  When I'm not programming... I might be playing Dragonheir: Silent Gods ðŸŽ®, spending time with my loved ones ðŸ’ž, listening to good music ðŸŽµ, or taking photos ðŸ“¸.

  Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to browse my [projects](/projects) or [get in touch](/#contact) if you'd like to contact me!
